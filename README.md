# Energy-Efficiency
This study looked into assessing the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings (that is, energy efficiency) as a function of building parameters.

# Purpose
The solution proposed here is to implemented a number of classical and non-parametric statistical analytic tools to carefully analyse the strength of each input variable's correlation with each of the output variables in order to discover the most strongly associated input variables to perform analysis for different shapes is a machine learning-based regressor model which will help us to predict the value of heating load and cooling load .
